    `type` is optional and advisory: the session type is always resolved from this account's own
    history, so only sessions you own can be read. resolvedType:false means the id isn't in your
    history. Rowing/ski sessions add `cardio` (pace per 500m, speed, watts, calories/min); guided
    cardio adds per-interval rows, and rowing with recorded telemetry adds `rowing` — per-block
    stroke rate, pace, watts and how much of each block stayed inside its target stroke-rate band.
    Weights are already in displayUnit — never convert.
    Set modes: a session records no mode (standard/chain/eccentric) and no overload amount. Per-rep
    weights are measured force, so a chain set's weight (and the exercise's topWeight) reads above
    the load that was set, and an eccentric set shows only the concentric load. The only record of
    which sets were chain or eccentric is the source template, which Speediance rewrites after each
    session; when that record still belongs to this session, each exercise carries `modeHint` per
    set. Without modeHint the modes are unknown — don't assume standard for a surprising weight.

    Each exercise carries personalBests — a subset of ["weight", "volume", "1RM"] — and the reply has a
    session-level personalBests summary [{exercise, kinds}]. These are Speediance's OWN flags, set when
    the session was saved: heaviest weight, most volume or best estimated 1RM for that movement at that
    time. They do not mean it is still the all-time best, and they are not ours (get_strength_profile
    computes its own estimates). Only custom-template sessions carry them; Free Lift and off-machine
    exercises always show none, which means "no flag available", not "no PB". Speediance's figures are
    measured force and the session carries no set-mode field, so a chain-mode set logs a higher weight
    than its setting and can set a weight or volume PB: treat those two with care on chain work."""
