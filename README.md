# speediance-mcp

A free, open-source [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets Claude read and manage your
**Speediance Gym Monster** training: your session history, per-set logs, exercise progress, rowing stats,
heart rate, custom workouts and schedule — plus off-machine training and a coaching memory of your goals,
injuries and preferences.

It's a self-hosted alternative to GM Manager. It runs on your own computer, talks directly to Speediance,
and keeps everything it stores on your machine.

> **Unofficial.** Not affiliated with or endorsed by Speediance. It uses the private API behind the
> Speediance mobile app, which can change without notice.

## What you can do with it

Once it's connected you just talk to Claude. Things that work today:

**Review what you actually did**

> *"How was last week?"* — sessions, minutes, volume and calories, with phone-health activity counted
> separately from gym sessions.
>
> *"What did I do in Monday's session?"* — every exercise, set, rep and weight, plus rowing pace/power
> or guided-cardio intervals where there are any.
>
> *"Is my bench press going anywhere?"* — that movement's trend, week by week.
>
> *"Compare Monday to the last time I did that workout."* — per-movement deltas in top weight, reps
> and volume.

**Plan the next one**

> *"Build me a 40-minute upper session with the barbell, and skip anything that hits my left shoulder."*
>
> *"What weight should I use for 8 reps of Romanian deadlift, leaving 2 in reserve?"* — an Epley
> estimate from your own best set, and it tells you what it based that on.
>
> *"Which muscles have I been neglecting this month?"* — volume spread across the muscles each movement
> works (main 100%, assisting 50%), with push:pull and upper:lower ratios.
>
> *"Put that workout on Thursday."*

**Train away from the machine**

> *"At the hotel this morning I did 3×12 dumbbell bench at 40, 3×10 single-arm rows at 45 a side, and
> 3×20 push-ups."*

Claude records it and matches each movement to the Speediance library, so it counts towards your
volume-by-muscle and can set a personal best — detail Speediance itself cannot store. Backdating works,
so a whole trip can be caught up in one message. See [Off-machine training](#off-machine-training).

**Let it remember things**

> *"My left shoulder doesn't like overhead pressing — don't program it."* → saved as a hard constraint
> and respected in every workout it builds afterwards.
>
> *"I've got a flat bench and a barbell, no cable attachments."* → equipment it plans around.
>
> *"I hate Bulgarian split squats."* → marked ⊘ avoided, and never programmed again unless you ask for
> it by name.

It also keeps your goal, training days and session length, so you don't repeat yourself — and it flags
contradictions between saved facts instead of quietly picking one.

## Off-machine training

Speediance's own manual log makes a day count towards your streak, days trained, minutes and calories,
but it stores **no exercises** — and they can't be pushed in. The session-save route is an *update* into
a row the machine itself creates (asking it to resolve a client-invented session id returns nothing), so
a workout that never ran on the hardware cannot be written at all.

So `log_off_machine_workout` keeps that detail locally instead, and the rest of the server treats it as
real training:

- `get_muscle_balance` includes it, and reports `offMachineDays` / `offMachineSets` separately — it's
  training, but not a session the machine recorded.
- `get_session_detail` on a manual session serves those exercises and says where they came from.
- Movements resolve to the library by name, which is what makes them attributable to muscles. One that
  Speediance doesn't stock is still logged and reported as unmatched rather than refused.
- Single-arm sets keep their side and aren't counted as both; bodyweight work is recorded, not rejected.

## Recovery and health

> *"Am I recovered enough for legs today?"*

`get_recovery` reads what the Speediance app's Health tab shows: its physical-condition model (fitness,
fatigue and their ratio, the acute:chronic workload ratio), last night's sleep with deep/core/REM/awake
against the app's healthy ranges, the Wellness Monitor (HRV, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, respiratory
rate and skin temperature, each against **your own** baseline band), and how fatigued each muscle is from
recent training. `get_athlete_snapshot` carries the same readout, so planning sees it without an extra call,
and `get_readiness_trend` gives the day-by-day view.

Most of this is your phone's health data (Apple Health or Health Connect) relayed through Speediance, so it
needs a watch or ring syncing sleep and HRV to the phone, and health sharing turned on in the Speediance app.
Without one, those sections come back empty and `feeds` says so.

## Install

You need **Python 3.10 or newer**. Check with `python3 --version` (Windows: `py --version`).
Get Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.

The easiest way is **pipx**, which installs the command in its own isolated environment:

| OS | Install pipx | Install speediance-mcp |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath` | `pipx install git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp` |
| Windows | `py -m pip install --user pipx && py -m pipx ensurepath` | `pipx install git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp` |
| Linux | `python3 -m pip install --user pipx && python3 -m pipx ensurepath` | `pipx install git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp` |

Open a new terminal after `ensurepath`. Alternatives: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp speediance-mcp`,
or `pip install git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp` inside a virtual environment.

### Sign in

```
speediance-mcp login
```

Enter your Speediance email and password. By default the password is **remembered**, so an expired
session renews silently. If you'd rather not store it, use `speediance-mcp login --no-remember`: only the
session token is kept, and you run `speediance-mcp login` again when it expires.

### Choose a client type (so you don't get signed out of your phone or your machine)

Speediance allows **one signed-in session per client type**, not per account. Every Speediance app and
machine signs in as a type, and a new sign-in with a type signs out whatever was using it:

| `--client-type` | Speediance's own user of that slot | Signing in with it signs out... |
|---|---|---|
| `phone` | The Speediance phone app | your phone app (and your phone signs this server out) |
| `gym-monster` | The Gym Monster | your Gym Monster |
| `nano` | Gym Nano | a Gym Nano on your account, if you have one |
| `bike` (default) | Speediance bike | a Speediance bike on your account, if you have one |

**Pick a type that no device of yours uses:**

- **Gym Monster, no Nano or bike (most people):** keep the default, `bike`.
- **You also own a Speediance bike:** use `--client-type nano`.
- **You own both a Nano and a bike:** use `--client-type phone`, and expect your phone app and this server
  to sign each other out. Never use `gym-monster` unless you want to be signed out at the machine.
- **Running two tools on the same account** (for example this server and another Speediance tool): give
  them different free types, or they will sign each other out.

With `nano` or `bike`, if something else does take the slot, the server quietly signs back in (with a
remembered password). With `phone` or `gym-monster` it never does that automatically, since it would sign
your phone or machine out again; it tells you to run `speediance-mcp login` instead.

`speediance-mcp status` shows the client type you signed in with. These types were found by testing (they
aren't documented by Speediance), and a future Speediance update could change them.

Use `--region EU` if your account is on Speediance's EU servers, and `--device-type 2` for a Gym Pal.
Login also downloads the exercise library (about 30 seconds, once a day at most).

Exercise and workout names come back in your system locale's language when Speediance carries it
(English, German, French, Spanish, Italian or Korean), and in English otherwise. Pick one explicitly
with `--language de` at login, or set `SPEEDIANCE_LANGUAGE`. Without any language the Speediance API
answers in Chinese, which is why this is always sent.

`speediance-mcp status` shows who you're signed in as; `speediance-mcp logout` signs out and deletes the
stored credentials.

## Connect Claude

### Claude Desktop

Open the config file (Claude Desktop → Settings → Developer → Edit Config), or create it:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "speediance": { "command": "speediance-mcp" }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop.

**macOS:** Claude Desktop doesn't see your shell's `PATH`, so it usually can't find commands in
`~/.local/bin` (where pipx puts them). Use the full path that `which speediance-mcp` prints:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "speediance": { "command": "/Users/you/.local/bin/speediance-mcp" }
  }
}
```

**Windows:** if Claude can't find the command, use the full path that `where speediance-mcp` prints. JSON
needs forward slashes or doubled backslashes — `"C:/Users/you/.local/bin/speediance-mcp.exe"` or
`"C:\\Users\\you\\.local\\bin\\speediance-mcp.exe"`, never single backslashes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "speediance": { "command": "C:/Users/you/.local/bin/speediance-mcp.exe" }
  }
}
```

**With uvx instead of pipx** (sign in first with
`uvx --from git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp speediance-mcp login`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "speediance": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/labatt/speediance-mcp", "speediance-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On macOS, use the full path from `which uvx` as the `command` for the same reason as above.

### Claude Code

```
claude mcp add speediance -- speediance-mcp
```

Then ask Claude something like *"How did my last pull workout compare to the one before?"*

## Use it on claude.ai (remote mode)

claude.ai (web and mobile apps) connects to MCP servers over the internet, so this mode needs a
machine that's always on and reachable over HTTPS.

1. On that machine, install and sign in as above (`speediance-mcp login`). The remote sign-in page
   only accepts this same Speediance account.
2. Run the server (keep it running with systemd, pm2 or similar):
   ```
   speediance-mcp serve --http --public-url https://mcp.example.com
   ```
   It listens on `127.0.0.1:8765`. Put a TLS reverse proxy in front. nginx (the `limit_req` lines
   are optional but recommended: they slow down anyone hammering the sign-in and OAuth endpoints):
   ```nginx
   # at http level (e.g. in /etc/nginx/conf.d/speediance.conf, outside the server block):
   limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=speediance_oauth:10m rate=10r/m;

   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name mcp.example.com;
       # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key: e.g. from `certbot --nginx -d mcp.example.com`
       location ~ ^/(register|authorize|login|token)$ {
           limit_req zone=speediance_oauth burst=20 nodelay;
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_buffering off;
           proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
       }
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_buffering off;
           proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
       }
   }
   ```
   Caddy (fetches the certificate itself):
   ```
   mcp.example.com {
       reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8765 {
           header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
       }
   }
   ```
   The server reads `X-Real-IP` from this local proxy to rate-limit sign-in attempts by the
   caller's real address, so whichever proxy you use must set that header.
3. In claude.ai: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, URL `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`.
   Claude opens the sign-in page; enter your Speediance email and password.

By default only clients that redirect to `claude.ai`, `claude.com`, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` can
connect. To let another MCP client connect (for example a self-hosted or third-party one), add its
redirect host with `--allow-redirect-host`, repeatable:

```
speediance-mcp serve --http --public-url https://mcp.example.com --allow-redirect-host client.example
```

To disconnect claude.ai and every other remote client, run `speediance-mcp revoke`.
`speediance-mcp logout` also stops the server using your Speediance account until you sign in again.

Security:

- Only clients that redirect to `claude.ai`, `claude.com`, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` can connect;
  add others with `--allow-redirect-host`.
- After repeated wrong sign-ins, the sign-in page locks for up to 15 minutes.
- Someone who knows the server's address can keep new sign-ins locked out by repeatedly failing
  (20 failed attempts per 15 minutes overall lock everyone out). Existing connections keep working;
  the nginx `limit_req` lines above make this slower.
- Only the account the server was set up with can connect; tokens are stored hashed; access tokens
  last an hour and refresh automatically.

The `--client-type` you pass to `speediance-mcp login` (see
[Choose a client type](#choose-a-client-type-so-you-dont-get-signed-out-of-your-phone-or-your-machine))
is also the slot every remote sign-in through this server uses — with `phone`, a claude.ai sign-in
through it signs your phone app out, the same as it would locally. Give a local copy of the server
a different free slot if you run both.

## Tools

All weights are in your account's display unit (kg or lb) — nothing is converted.

⊘ avoided marks (with an optional reason) are shared with the companion web app when both use the same
data dir; `create_workout` and `update_workout` flag any avoided exercise they were asked to include.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check_connection` | Verify the Speediance login is live |
| `get_calendar` | A month's scheduled and completed sessions |
| `get_session_detail` | One session's per-exercise log — sets, reps, weights; rowing pace/power; guided-cardio intervals |
| `get_heart_rate` | A watch-paired session's heart-rate curve and summary |
| `get_training_stats` | Totals between two dates |
| `get_athlete_snapshot` | Profile, coaching memory, recent sessions and today's recovery in one call |
| `get_strength_profile` | Estimated 1RM per recently trained movement |
| `get_muscle_balance` | Which muscles the recent work loaded, push:pull and upper:lower, and what's been missed |
| `get_recovery` | Today's readiness: training status and load ratio, last night's sleep and stages, HRV / resting HR / SpO2 / respiratory rate / skin temperature against your own baseline, and per-muscle fatigue |
| `get_readiness_trend` | Training status and sleep day by day, up to 14 days |
| `get_body_metrics` | Latest weight, body fat, BMI, lean mass and FFMI, plus cardio fitness, strength score and body age |
| `compare_sessions` | A session versus the previous one, per movement |
| `suggest_load` | A working weight for a rep target, with its reasoning |
| `list_exercises` | Search the exercise library (body part, equipment, what you own) |
| `get_exercise` | One movement's muscles, equipment, form cues and media |
| `mark_exercise` | Mark a movement ★ preferred or ⊘ avoided |
| `list_accessories` | Speediance's accessories, flagged with what you own |
| `get_exercise_history` | One movement's week-by-week trend, oldest to newest (Speediance buckets this by week, not by session) |
| `list_my_workouts` | Your saved custom workouts |
| `get_workout` | One workout's full prescription |
| `create_workout` | Create a workout (verified by reading it back) |
| `update_workout` | Edit a workout in place |
| `delete_workout` | Delete a workout |
| `schedule_workout` | Put a workout on a day |
| `unschedule_workout` | Take a workout off a day |
| `browse_programs` | Speediance's official programs |
| `get_preferences` | The coaching memory |
| `set_preferences` | Goal, training days, session length, load anchors, owned and unusable equipment |
| `remember_fact` | Save one curated fact: a hard/soft constraint, preference, goal or observation (max 600 characters; near-duplicates are refused; `supersedes` replaces older facts) |
| `forget_fact` | Archive a fact that no longer applies (kept in the history) |
| `list_facts` | Audit the facts, optionally with the full history of superseded, forgotten and expired ones |
| `import_facts` | Save many facts at once under the same rules, with a `dry_run` report first |
| `log_off_machine_workout` | Record a workout done away from the machine (hotel gym, free weights) so it counts towards volume and personal bests |
| `get_off_machine_log` | Off-machine workouts logged between two dates |
| `delete_off_machine_day` | Remove one day from the off-machine log (never touches Speediance) |

19 of these use GM Manager's tool names and, for most, its parameter names (`template_id`, `groupId`,
`add`...), so prompts written for GM Manager keep working: `check_connection`, `get_calendar`,
`get_session_detail`, `get_exercise_history`, `get_athlete_snapshot`, `get_strength_profile`, `list_exercises`,
`mark_exercise`, `list_my_workouts`, `get_workout`, `create_workout`, `update_workout`, `delete_workout`,
`schedule_workout`, `suggest_load`, `get_preferences`, `set_preferences`, `remember_fact` and `forget_fact`.
The other 16 are new: `get_heart_rate`, `get_training_stats`, `compare_sessions`, `get_exercise`,
`list_accessories`, `unschedule_workout`, `browse_programs`, `list_facts`, `import_facts`,
`get_muscle_balance`, `log_off_machine_workout`, `get_off_machine_log`, `delete_off_machine_day`,
`get_recovery`, `get_readiness_trend` and `get_body_metrics`.
`set_preferences`,
`suggest_load` and `create_workout` take simpler inputs: typed preference fields instead of one JSON blob, and
no RM presets yet (per-set standard, chain and eccentric modes are supported; the overload is dialled in on
the machine). `remember_fact` and `forget_fact` differ from GM Manager's (see
below).

**Coaching facts** are curated rather than free text. Each fact has a `kind` — a `constraint` (with `severity`
`hard` or `soft`), a `preference`, a `goal` or an `observation` — and a `category` (`injury`, `equipment`,
`schedule`, `body`, `nutrition`, `note`), an optional `scope` (e.g. `location:tampa-hotel`) and a `source`
(`user` or `inferred`). A fact is at most 600 characters: longer ones are refused with the count, never
truncated. A new fact that nearly repeats an active one isn't saved; you get the near-match back and can re-send
it with `supersedes` to replace the old one, which is archived in the same write. `forget_fact(id)` archives
rather than deletes, and expired facts archive themselves. `get_preferences` and `get_athlete_snapshot` return
only active facts, grouped as `constraints` (`hard`, `soft`), `preferences`, `goals`, the 10 most recent
`observations`, and `conflicts`: pairs of active facts in the same category that look like the same topic but
differ on a number or a negation, with both ids, so Claude asks you instead of picking one. `list_facts` shows
the full history. Facts with different scopes (e.g. `location:home` and `location:tampa-hotel`) never count as
duplicates or conflicts. When a refused near-match differs in kind, severity, scope, a number or a negation, the
reply names the difference so an upgrade isn't lost. Facts saved before this change are kept as legacy facts:
reads list them as `legacyUnreviewed` (and count them in `legacyToReview`) until each one is re-saved with
`supersedes` (via `remember_fact` or `import_facts`; a long one can be split into several pieces in one import)
or forgotten. Until then they may still bind, and Claude treats injury ones as hard constraints.
`create_workout` and `update_workout` replies repeat your `hardConstraints` and `legacyUnreviewed` facts so
Claude re-checks the workout against them.

**Rowing:** every rowing session gets distance, pace per 500m, speed, average power and calories per minute.
Guided cardio sessions (like "Aerobic Rowing") also get per-interval rows. Rowing done as a course or custom
workout gets a `rowing` block instead: the machine records a sample every few seconds, so each programmed
piece reports its stroke rate, pace, watts, and how much of it stayed inside the target stroke-rate band.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not signed in to Speediance, or the session expired."** Run `speediance-mcp login`. A remembered
  password (the default) renews an expired session automatically; after `--no-remember`, sign in again.
- **Your phone app or Gym Monster keeps getting signed out.** You're signed in with the `phone` or
  `gym-monster` client type. Run `speediance-mcp login --client-type bike` (or `nano`) — see
  [Choose a client type](#choose-a-client-type-so-you-dont-get-signed-out-of-your-phone-or-your-machine).
- **A tool still says to sign in after you ran `speediance-mcp login`.** Restart Claude so the server starts
  fresh with the new login.
- **Claude doesn't list the tools.** Check the config JSON is valid, use the command's full path, and restart
  Claude.
- **The first exercise search is slow.** The library downloads once (about 30 seconds) and is then cached
  for a day.
- **A workout comes back `verified: false`.** Speediance stored something different from what was sent.
  Check the workout in the Speediance app before training and please open an issue with your unit (kg or lb).

## Companion project: the web app

**[SmartGym Workout Manager for Speediance](https://github.com/labatt/speediance-smartgym-workout-manager)**
is a separate, free Flask app over the same Speediance data — a browser UI rather than a conversation.
The two projects are independent and each works alone.

|  | speediance-mcp (this) | The web app |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | Conversation with Claude | Browser UI you click through |
| Best at | Asking questions, planning, "log what I did at the hotel" | Charts, the workout builder, scanning history, schedule grids |
| Per-rep telemetry | — | Power/resistance charts per rep, form scores |
| Personal bests | — | Dashboard cards, all-time |
| Coaching memory | Full curated facts: injuries, goals, schedule, equipment | Avoided exercises |
| Off-machine logging | `log_off_machine_workout` in chat | A form at `/offmachine` |
| Runs as | A local process Claude launches, or a remote server | A Flask site you host |

**This server works on its own.** It never imports the web app and never calls it over the network.

**If you run both, they share one SQLite file** in this server's data folder, so they can't disagree:

- Exercises you mark ⊘ **avoided** here are respected there, and vice versa.
- **Off-machine workouts** you log through Claude show up immediately in the web app's dashboard,
  history and personal bests.
- Owned/unusable **equipment** and coaching preferences are shared.

Both projects declare the shared tables identically, and a test fails if the two definitions ever drift.
One asymmetry worth knowing: the web app maintains a cache of per-session stats used for its personal-best
cards. This server neither writes nor reads it, so nothing here depends on the web app being installed.

> **Running both? Use different client types.** Speediance allows one live session per *client type*, so
> point them at different ones — e.g. this server on `nano` and the web app on `bike` — or signing in with
> one signs the other out. See
> [Choose a client type](#choose-a-client-type-so-you-dont-get-signed-out-of-your-phone-or-your-machine).

## Your data

Everything lives in one folder (run `speediance-mcp status` to see it):

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\speediance-mcp`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/speediance-mcp`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/speediance-mcp`

It holds `credentials.json` (your token, and your password unless you signed in with `--no-remember`), `speediance-mcp.db`
(the coaching memory) and the exercise-library cache. On macOS and Linux the credentials file is readable only
by you; on Windows it relies on your user profile folder's permissions. Delete the folder to erase everything.
Set `SPEEDIANCE_MCP_HOME` to use a different folder.

Nothing is sent anywhere except Speediance's own servers. Requests are paced at one per second.

## Security notes

- **Unofficial API.** This uses the private API behind the Speediance app. It isn't supported by Speediance
  and can change or break without notice.
- **Credentials stay on your computer.** `credentials.json` in the data folder holds your session token — and
  your password unless you used `--no-remember`. On macOS and Linux it (and a newly created data folder) is
  readable only by you.
- **One session per client type.** Speediance signs out whoever last used the same client type. With the
  default `bike` type (or `nano`), this server doesn't share a slot with your phone or your Gym Monster —
  see [Choose a client type](#choose-a-client-type-so-you-dont-get-signed-out-of-your-phone-or-your-machine).
- **Nothing is sent anywhere but Speediance.** No telemetry, no third-party services; tokens and passwords are
  never logged.

## Development

```
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v
```

Tests are offline and use synthetic data only. Maintainers can run this manual check against a real account
before a release:

- sign in and run `get_athlete_snapshot`;
- create, verify and delete a throwaway workout;
- create a workout with a Vita (level) exercise and confirm the level shows correctly in the Speediance app;
- call `get_heart_rate` on a watch-paired session.
